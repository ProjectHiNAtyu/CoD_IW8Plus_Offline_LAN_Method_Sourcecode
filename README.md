# This source code is for modded clients that have completed the Arxan Bypass and Offline Fence Bypass for MW19 1.38.
# This code alone will not work; the client code is required.

This source code is intended exclusively for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) version 1.38 (Battle.net build) and allows you to directly join a LAN session lobby.

By the way, this method can be used across all CoD titles, including MW19, VG, MWII, and MWIII.

I sent the base of this code to BodNJenie, and he adjusted it to some extent for use on the client.

Special thanks to .r4v3n, the original discoverer who provided LAN-related hints in the MW19 Beta README.

If you have any questions or issues, please contact me on my Discord.

I have also released completed modded clients that use this LAN code.

If you need them, please visit the repository below to download them.
